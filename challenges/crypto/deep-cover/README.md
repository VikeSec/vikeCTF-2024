## Description

As the Viking ship sailed across the vast North Sea, its crew encountered unexpected turbulence in the form of a message. Amidst the rugged expanse of the waters, a messenger bird descended, bearing a weather report inscribed in Cyrillic script. With furrowed brows, the Norsemen deciphered the ominous tidings, seeking the hidden meaning within.

## Organizers

This challenge uses a simple substitution cipher to encrypt a message. The plaintext should be written to `plaintext.txt`. Then, running `python substitution.py` will store the ciphertext in `ciphertext.txt`.

To run the challenge, give participants `ciphertext.txt`.

## Solution

The challenge should either be solved manually, or using statistical analysis tools such as https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cryptogram
