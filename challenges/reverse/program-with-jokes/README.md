## Description

Unravel the enigma behind this funny program and showcase your tactical prowess like never before.

## Organizers

Give competitors the `encrypted.lol` file

## Solution

This is a simple [LOLCODE](https://esolangs.org/wiki/LOLCODE) program. Reading the documentation we see that the program is constructing an array with named variables. Those variables are then being concatenated to check against the stdin. So that decoded section is `L01C475_GG`, and concatenated with the starting `vikeCTF{3S073riC_` and ending `}` we get `vikeCTF{3S073riC_L01C475_GG}`.

## Flag

```
vikeCTF{3S073riC_L01C475_GG}
```
